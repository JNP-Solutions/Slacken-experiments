## Quality metrics for Slacken (and Kraken 2) classification experiments 

The files `All_metrics.tsv` and `All_bmetrics.tsv` contain experimental results for Slacken and Kraken 2. 
Each line in the files corresponds to the classification of a single metagenomic sample with a given set of parameters, 
and then comparing with the known ground truth. For bmetrics, Bracken has also been applied after running either Slacken or Kraken 2.

The following parameters were fixed for all experiments: k (k-mer size) = 35, m (minimizer width) = 31, s = 7.
These are the Kraken 2 defaults.

All_metrics contains a total of 14,080 experiments (compared at species and genus level), and all_bmetrics contains 7,040 
experiments (compared at species level only, since this is more meaningful with Bracken).
A total of 160 samples from six sample groups were classified.

### Common columns in both files

* Library: genomic library: "std" or "rspc" in the case of Slacken, or "kraken2" to indicate that Kraken 2 was used with the std library.
* Group: sample family (e.g. CAMI2 strain/plant_associated/marine, or the noise model for in silico samples). 
When using Slacken, samples in the same group were classified together in multisample mode. For strain samples, samples 0-50 
and samples 51-99 were classified as two separate groups for technical reasons.
* Sample: unique sample identifier within the group. For CAMI2 samples, this corresponds to the CAMI2 sample ID.
* c: confidence score for Slacken/Kraken 2 classification. We evaluated c=0.15, 0.10, 0.05 and 0.00.

### Table S1: [All_metrics.tsv](All_metrics.tsv) (read binning results, pre-Bracken)

This file was generated by the `compare` command in Slacken.

* Rank: level of comparison (Species or Genus) when comparing with the ground truth. All results in the paper are based 
on a species-level comparison. We also include genus-level experiments here for completeness.

#### Taxon metrics
* taxon_classified: number of identified taxa. A taxon is considered to be identified if it has at least 10 reads 
assigned to it. This test has no relation to the 2-step heuristic threshold (R10, R100 etc).
* taxon_total: total number of taxa in the reference (no threshold) 
* taxon_precision precision of the classified taxon set (|true classified|/|classified|)
* taxon_recall recall of the classified taxon set (|true classified|/|total|)

#### Read metrics

* read_classified: number of classified reads
* read_total: total number of reads in the sample
* read_tp: number of reads correctly classified
* read_vp: number of reads vaguely classified (in the lineage above the true taxon)
* read_fp: number of reads incorrectly classified
* read_fn: number of reads not classified (but that had a ground truth mapping)
* read_ppv: precision of read classifications (|tp|/(|tp| + |fp|))
* read_sensitivity: sensitivity of read classifications (|tp|/|total|)
* read_recall: recall of read classifications (|tp|/(|tp| + |fn|))
* read_index: index -- a weighted average of the specificity of each read (see our paper for details)
* read_softIndex: soft index -- a weighted average of specificity that also penalises false negatives 
(see our paper for details)

#### Read fractions of total metrics

These are the same as the corresponding metrics above, but as fractions of the total number of reads instead of 
absolute counts.
* read_tp_frac 
* read_fp_frac
* read_vp_frac
* read_fn_frac
* read_classified_frac

### Table S2: [All_bmetrics.tsv](All_bmetrics.tsv) (read profiling results, post-Bracken)

This file was computed by `scripts/comparison/compare_bracken_kraken.scala`. The ground truth was for the CAMI2 samples
obtained from the CAMI2 gold standard mapping, where reads that had no species-level mapping were first filtered out.
This allowed us to compare with a true read profile for each sample. For In Silico samples, the ground truth was known
by construction.

#### Ground truth distances

* LSE: LSE (Euclidean) distance from the ground truth mapping. Each taxon is treated as a fraction of reads, so each 
sample is represented as a vector with entries in the range [0,1].
* LSE (log10) LSE distance measured after applying log base 10 to the entries in the vectors.
* L1 L1 (Manhattan) distance from the ground truth mapping. 
* L1 (log10) L1 (Manhattan) distance after applying log base 10 to the entries in the vectors.

#### Taxon metrics

* TP: number of true positive taxa
* FP: number of false positive taxa
* FN: number of false negative taxa
* Precision: precision of the taxon set (|tp|/|classified|)
* Recall: recall of the taxon set (|tp|/|reference|)

#### Other

* Added reads: fraction of reads added by Bracken

## Taxon detection heuristic metrics for Slacken

### Table S3: [heuristicTaxa.tsv](heuristicTaxa.tsv)

The file `heuristicTaxa.tsv` contains details about the taxon sets detected by the various heuristics (R1, R10, R100) 
during 2-step classification. Each line corresponds to one multi-sample run of Slacken with a given sample family, genomic library, and heuristic.

* Type: in silico or CAMI2 samples
* Dataset: sample family, e.g. strain/marine/plant_associated for CAMI2, or the noise model for in silico samples.
Strain samples 0-50 and 51-99 were run separately, so that family has twice as many datasets as the others.
* Classifier: library and heuristic used, e.g. std_R10 for the standard library with the R10 heuristic.
* Detected taxa: Number of species-level taxa detected
* Expanded taxa: Number of taxa in the detected set after adding descendants, such as strain taxa
* Gold set size: Number of species-level (and below) taxa in the gold set for this sample family. 
This is the set of taxa from the union of the ground truth mappings for all the samples in this run, promoted to a higher
level if necessary (e.g. strain to species) to match the genomic library being used.
* TP: Number of true positive taxa detected (members of the gold set)
* FP: Number of false positives detected
* FN: Number of false negatives (members of the gold set not detected)
* Precision: Precision of the detected taxon set (|tp|/|detected|)
* Recall: Recall of the detected taxon set (|tp|/|gold set|)
